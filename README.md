# Transform Keras Model Weights to Pytorch Model

## Introduction

Read Keras model weights from .h5 file and initialize Pytorch model with the weights. Write Pytorch model into .pt file.

## Setup

The code needs to be modified to your purpose.

1. Add your Pytorch network and import it to the file.
1. Read Keras model properly: define model file name and add needed custom objects to 'load_model' function.
